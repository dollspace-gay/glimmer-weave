# Local cargo config for glimmer_weave
# Overrides workspace config to allow tests to run on host platform

[build]
# Use host target instead of custom x86_64-aethelos target
# This allows tests to run with std library
target = "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"

# DO NOT build std from source for tests - use pre-compiled std
# This prevents duplicate lang item errors
# (Workspace config has build-std which we need to override)

[unstable]
# Explicitly disable build-std from workspace config
# This prevents duplicate lang item errors when running tests
