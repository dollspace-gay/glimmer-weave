# Local cargo config for glimmer_weave
# Overrides workspace config to allow tests to run on host platform

[build]
# Commented out to allow cargo to use the default host target
# This builds binaries in target/release instead of target/<arch>/release
# target = "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"

# DO NOT build std from source for tests - use pre-compiled std
# This prevents duplicate lang item errors
# (Workspace config has build-std which we need to override)

[unstable]
# Explicitly disable build-std from workspace config
# This prevents duplicate lang item errors when running tests
